# music-code-katas

The beginning of a collection of code katas specifically for learning and interacting with live-coding music creation environments such as Sonic Pi, Overtone, and others.

Here is a starting point for these katas. Eventually code examples will be added.

1. Code a childrenâ€™s song, twinkle twinkle little star, etc
1. Play a chord
1. Make a single note sound short and percussive, then make it sound long and languid
1. Make a sound like a sci-fi laser
1. Make a sound echo
1. Play a sound and make it louder and softer while playing
1. Create some polyphonic melodies
1. Craft the amen break
1. Put a bassline with some drums
1. Create a musical fizz buzz where you hear a fizz on seconds divisible by 3 and a buzz on seconds divisible by 5, and a drum kick otherwise
1. Create a simple sequencer

For platforms where you can create your own synth definitions and filter definitions

1. Make a noise synth def
1. Make a drum synth def
1. Create an echo filter
1. Create a delay filter
